## accessibility
The main contribution to this project was the changes that I made in ordrer to improve the accessibility of the webside. The entire content was mase with <div> elements, therefor I introduced elements such: <head> <section> <main> <aside> and <footer>.

Sice I am in the very beginning of my web developer career, i found this entire project difficult. In order to do it I did a lot of research on the topic of web accessibility.
