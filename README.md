## accessibility

## contribution
The main contribution to this project was the changes that I made in ordrer to improve the accessibility of the webside. The entire content was mase with <div> elements, therefor I introduced elements such: <head> <section> <main> <aside> and <footer>.
## level of dificulty
Sice I am in the very beginning of my web developer career, I found this entire project difficult. In order to do it I did a lot of research on the topic of web accessibility. 

## Page layout
I devided the page in header, main, asside, and footer.
The header inform the user that there is the name of the page "Horiseon" and 3 links in the right top corner which after accessing them, the user go in the main content on the page and find there more details about the respective link. 

Between the header and main content of the page on the screen apears a image, which provide an alt description for accessibility. 

The main conten is divided in 3 sections, each of them have a image and a short paragraph.

On the right side is displayed the asside element which also contains three sections that provides the benefits of the company.

In the footer is placed the copyright police of the company, along with a h2 element.
